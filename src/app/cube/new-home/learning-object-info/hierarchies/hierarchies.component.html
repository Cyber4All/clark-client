    <p class="taxonomy">Learning outcomes gives both educators and learners explicit learning goals for a learning object. This allows 
      educators to build their assessments correctly. Outcomes also provide language which enables students to effectively articulate 
      what they have learned.</p>

    <h1>Related curricula grouped hierarchically</h1>
    <!-- Dummy text until the full text is provided for this section -->
    <p>A learning object is not just a single lesson or lab and although they can often be used individually, it is often constructed 
      of multiple labs and lessons. Hierarchies on CLARK are designed to provide a structure for combining individual learning objects 
      into larger modules, units, or courses. Taking a modular approach to creating curriculum allows for educators to organize their 
      materials in a way that supports the learning outcomes and allows easy use in the classroom.</p>
