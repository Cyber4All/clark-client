      <p class="notice-title">Notice Regarding NSA NCCP Course Materials</p>
      <p>These course materials were created under a U.S. Government grant. The terms of the Call for Proposals advised the course
        creator that the materials would be made "publicly available for educational institutions" to educate and prepare their
        graduates for potential future employment with the U.S. Government in the cybersecurity field. The terms of the grant
        further provided that, with respect to any copyright in the materials, the U.S. Government reserved a royalty-free, nonexclusive
        and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others
        to do so. Strengthening the Nation's cybersecurity, particularly through cybersecurity education at all levels of education
        to foster the knowledge and skills of individuals who may ultimately join the U.S. Government, is an important Federal
        purpose. Consistent with the Call for Proposals and the terms of the grant, in making these materials publicly available
        the U.S. Government authorizes others to reproduce, publish and use them in furtherance of this Federal purpose.</p>
