    WHAT_BLURB: `CLARK is a platform for building and sharing free cybersecurity curriculum.
    It includes three components â€“ the model for building curriculum, the digital
    library system, and the curriculum collections. It was created because there is a
    demonstrated need for a high-quality and high-availability repository for
    curricular and ancillary resources in the cybersecurity education community.
    It provides cybersecurity faculty the building blocks to train the next
    wave of researchers and better prepare the cybersecurity workforce.`,
