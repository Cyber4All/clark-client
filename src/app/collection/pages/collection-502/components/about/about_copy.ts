    'ABOUT': `<p>The 502 Project (named for the \“Bad Gateway\” HTTP error code) seeks to develop a persistent
     cybersecurity community platform for high-school students, providing participants
     with access to peers and a diverse group of cybersecurity mentors. By connecting, supporting,
      and extending current efforts in cybersecurity education, the initiative capitalizes on the momentum
     of local programs throughout the year, providing students with ongoing challenges, networking opportunities, and mentorship.
      Representing a coalition of university and community college partners,
     the project will mobilize three main strategies for connecting local and regional
      cybersecurity education efforts into a centralized online community:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fostering of a safe, inclusive online community supporting
         cybersecurity education (“gateway”) programs aimed at high-school and community college populations</li>
        <li>Technical development of platform “bots” designed to provide challenges aligned with the
         National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF) and conduct student assessments/tracking</li>
        <li>Enrolling cybersecurity professionals and academic advisors to provide persistent
         mentorship and community moderation - capitalizing on the interest generated at cybersecurity events</li>
        <li>Sharing of cybersecurity curricula via an established, freely available, and open online repository (CLARK),
         with contributions from all partnering academic institutions</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This space is currently under construction, but will soon be the home of our repository of cybersecurity curricula.</p>
