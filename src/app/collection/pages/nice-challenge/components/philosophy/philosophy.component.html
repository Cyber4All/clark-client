          The NICE Challenge Project develops real-world cybersecurity 
          challenges within virtualized business environments that bring 
          students the workforce experience before the workforce. Our goal 
          is to provide the most realistic experiences to students, 
          at-scale year-round, while also generating useful assessment 
          data about their knowledge, skills, and abilities for educators.
